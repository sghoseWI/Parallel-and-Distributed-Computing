    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: If I ran first_process.py, A1 would print -- followed by B1, B2, and B3.  This is because, as the documentation states, os.execvp \"execute a new program, replacing the current process.\" More specifically, this would consequently mean that A2 would not print from the first process.  "

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The second script will run slower than the first script in part because of the Global Interpretor Lock in Python which is a mutex that makes it so that multiple threads cannot execute at the same time in the same program.  There is also communication overhead involved in each additional thread from the second script -- slowing down the execution of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason that the second script will run slower than the first script becomes more pronounced with increasing values of COUNT.  Specifically, the second script involves taking a COUNT, dividing it by 4, and having each of the four involved threads counting down successively.  An issue is that with larger and larger values of COUNT, the division operation required in each thread before they execute the countdown function takes longer and longer -- ultimately slowing down the whole script.  The nature of division operations is that larger input values take longer to compute.  Referenced StackOverflow for why division of larger numbers is more complex: \"Division is an iterative algorithm where the result from the quotient must be shifted to the remainder using a Euclidean measure, whereas, multiplication can be reduced to a (fixed) series of bit manipulation tricks.\"\n",

    "### 3A\n",
    "Answer: I would choose pool.map for this scenario because it returns the results of the functions in an ordered way.  We also want pool.map instead of pool.map_async because it incorporates the ability to conditionally block the next lines of code. Further, pool.map is the best option here because it supports running a function with a single argument -- where everything else in the function is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3B\n",
    "Answer: I would choose pool.starmap_async because it allows for multiple arguments.  Further, the results of the function are returned in an ordered fashion, and has no blocking.  I would not choose pool.map_asynch instead of pool.starmap_async because it does not returned ordered results despite meeting other required conditions in the problem.  "

    "I chose to approach my decision tree implementation by parallizing the split operations in the recursive building of the tree -- where the function calculates the optimal feature point to split each node of the tree in.  In order to find the optimal split point, my code calculates the mean square error between the relevant groups at each node -- and splits in parallel based on calculated thresholds for mean squared error at each level. There are some tradeoffs associated with my approach -- for example, there may be load balance issues between parallel processes of different operational complexity.  Another potential tradeoff is that there may be relatively high communication overhead involved in my approach because it calculates the mean squared error at every node (regardless of the size of the nodes themselves).  \n",
